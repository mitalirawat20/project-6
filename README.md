Rice Yield Categorization in Indian Districts
This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to classify rice yield levels (Low, Medium, High) across Indian districts, based on district-level agricultural data. By analyzing key features like crop area, production, and environmental factors, the model aims to support data-driven decision-making in agriculture, optimizing resource allocation and improving yield management.
